## If

In Go **if** declaration is written without brackets, but braces are mandatory :

`
if condition {
}
`

As for functions the opening brace has to be on the same line as the **if** keyword.

## If

Condition is a boolean expression.

Classic operators can be used :

<span style="color: green">`==, !=, <, <=, >, >=, &&, ||`</span>

## If

Condition may be preceded by an expression followed by a ";" (semicolon)

`
if expression; condition {
}
`

The expression may be used to initialise a variable whose scope will be limited to the if/else block

## If

The **else** clause is used in the classic way and **else if** can be put after each other.

```Go
if condition1 {
} else if condition2 {
} else {
}
```
<!-- .element: class="big-code" -->

## Functions and if

Write a function computing the **inverse** of a decimal number (1/x).

Note : think of the case where the number may be zero. In this case it would be a good idea to return also a boolean.
